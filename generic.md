Hello, I'm Stephen Ahiabah-Quarshie.

I currently work in Risk Modelling at JP Morgan Chase in London, UK. My role involves leading the development and implementation of credit risk models for international consumer banking portfolio. I utilize Python, advanced Excel, and SQL for in-depth analysis and regularly present credit risk findings to senior management and business stakeholders, emphasizing key drivers and their implications.

I earned my degree in Materials Science & Engineering from The University of Manchester, specializing in the industrial application of thermolectric and nuclear naterials. 

Over the course of my career, I’ve honed my expertise in data extraction, preparation, and evaluation, working closely with various teams to promptly resolve data-related challenges. I take pride in producing well-organized documentation and establishing robust testing procedures for statistical analysis. Additionally, I have experience in creating automated reporting dashboards to support stress testing and model validation.

I am proficient in programming languages such as Python, SAS, SQL, and VBA, and I am also skilled in tools like MS Excel, Tableau, Git, and Power BI.

Outside of my professional life, I maintain a personal blog where I explore sports analytics and programming concepts that fascinate me.

I am passionate about leveraging my skills in quantitative analysis and data science to make meaningful contributions in both the finance and sports industries.

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my projects or if you’d like a copy of my CV.

Best regards,
Steve
