Hello, my name is Stephen Ahiabah.

Currently, I work as a Quantitative Stress Testing Analyst at NatWest Group in London, UK. In my role, I am the lead analyst providing review and challenge stress testing results & models for NatWest Holding's retail banking portfolio, using Python, advanced Excel, and SQL for analysis. My role also includes presenting credit risk stress testing outcomes to senior management and business stakeholders, highlighting key drivers and implications.

I hold a degree in Materials Science and Engineering from The University of Manchester. Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in data extraction, preparation, and assessment, collaborating with various teams to resolve data-related issues promptly. I take pride in creating well-structured documentation and implementing robust testing procedures for statistical analysis. Additionally, I have experience in developing automated reporting dashboards to facilitate stress test analysis & model validation. 
I have proficiency in programming languages such as Python, SAS, SQL, and VBA. I am well-versed in MS Excel, Tableau, Git, and Power BI.

Outside of work, I maintain a personal blog, where I share insights on sports analytics and programming concepts that have intrigued me.

Overall, I am passionate about applying my skills in quantitative analysis and data science to contribute to both the finance & sports industries.

Feel free to reach out for any questions on my projects or a CV request.

Steve
